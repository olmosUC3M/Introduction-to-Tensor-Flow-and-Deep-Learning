# Introduction to Tensor Flow and Deep Learning

Python notebooks to get started with Tensorflow, Neural Neworks (NNs), Convolutional NNs, Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Networks. Most of the material is a personal wrap-up of all the material provided by [Google's Deep Learning course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730), so all credit goes to them.  Additionally, I added one more notebook to practice with the *CTC loss function in temporal models* and a another one on *Variational Autoencoders*.

* Python 3.5 required! *

/Notebook 1:/ How to train a logistic-regressor and a 2-layer NN with L2-norm regularization using TensorFlow. 


/Notebook 2:/ Convolutional NNs and Dropout Regularization 


/Notebook 3:/ Word Embeddings and the wor2vec model


/Notebook 4:/ Recurrent NNs and sequential character prediction 


/Notebook 5:/ Recurrent NNs and sequential character prediction from MCC features with Connectionist Temporal Classification 

/Notebook 6:/ Bi-directional LSTM RNN and sequential character prediction from MCC features with Connectionist Temporal Classification 

/Notebook 7:/ Amortized Variational Inference with Neural Networks and Variational Autoencoders
