# Introduction to Tensor Flow and Deep Learning

Python notebooks to get started with Tensorflow, Neural Neworks (NNs), Convolutional NNs, Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Networks. Most of the material is a personal wrap-up of all the material provided by [Google's Deep Learning course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730), so all credit goes to them.  Additionally, I added one more notebook to practice with the *CTC loss function in temporal models* and a another one on *Variational Autoencoders*.

**Python 3.5 required!**

- Notebook 1: How to train a logistic-regressor and a 2-layer NN with L2-norm regularization using TensorFlow. 


- Notebook 2: Convolutional NNs and Dropout Regularization 


- Notebook 3: Word Embeddings and the wor2vec model


- Notebook 4: Recurrent NNs and sequential character prediction 


- Notebook 5: Recurrent NNs and sequential character prediction from MCC features with Connectionist Temporal Classification 

- Notebook 6: Bi-directional LSTM RNN and sequential character prediction from MCC features with Connectionist Temporal Classification 

- Notebook 7: Amortized Variational Inference with Neural Networks and Variational Autoencoders
